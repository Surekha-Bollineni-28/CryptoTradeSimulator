# CryptoTradeSimulator
This project fetches live BTC-USDT orderbook data from the OKX exchange using WebSockets and simulates real-time market buy/sell trades. It calculates average price, slippage, and taker fees based on current market depth. Built with Python using asyncio, itâ€™s ideal for understanding how real-time trading engines work.
